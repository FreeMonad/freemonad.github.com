After looking into nearly every blog framework available, I ended up returning (happily) to Octopress on Github pages.

Ruby is a mysterious black box to me, but since I'm now committed to using Octopress to generate this - it is probably a good time to start poking at whatever the hell is inside the box and see what it does.
